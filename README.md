# Traffic-Situation-Prediction-Using-CNN-LSTM

This project aims to predict traffic situations based on vehicle count data using a hybrid **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model. Instead of using pre-built deep learning libraries, the model is implemented from scratch using **NumPy** to better understand the inner workings of CNNs and LSTMs.

## ðŸš€ Project Features
- **Custom CNN-LSTM Model**: A hybrid model that extracts spatial patterns with CNN and learns temporal dependencies with LSTM.
- **Feature Engineering**: Standardization and one-hot encoding for effective model training.
- **Sequence-based Training**: Uses time-series sequences to improve predictive performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model architecture with filters, sequence lengths, and hidden units.
- **Performance Evaluation**: 
- Achieves **39% accuracy** initially.
- Aims to reach **72% accuracy** (inbuilt model benchmark).
